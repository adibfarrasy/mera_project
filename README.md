# Mera Project #
My startup documentations. Project initiated in July 2020.


## Project Summary ##
Mera planned to use Raspberry Pi SBC to enable KPI-tracking Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) media players e.g. media reach, media impression, audience gender, etc.\
The computer vision feature is deployed in an AWS, and the device serves to send video and camera metadata to the AWS database to be inferred by the deployed model.

## What's Inside ##
*`device_firmware` directory contains the device codes that I developed for the Mera device.\
*`project_management` directory contains documents in the first few stages of the product lifecycle e.g. product requirements, Bill of Materials, FMEA, etc.
